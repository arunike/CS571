An unexpected server error `500` or "hung" response *may* occur during any of these requests. It is likely to do with your request. Make sure that you have included the appropriate headers and, if you are doing a POST, that you have a properly formatted and stringified JSON body. If the error persists, please contact a member of the course staff.

Make sure to include credentials and specify a content-type where appropriate. A valid `X-CS571-ID` must be included with each request, otherwise you will recieve a `401` in addition to any of the errors described below.

### Getting Messages for Chatroom

`GET` `https://cs571.org/api/f23/hw11/messages?chatroom=CHATROOM_NAME&page=PAGE_NUM`

There is no get all messages; you must get messages for a particular `chatroom`. **All messages are public**, you do *not* need to be logged in to access them. Furthermore, a `page` may be specified. Each `page` contains up to 25 messages, and there are up to 4 pages. Messages made over 100 messages ago are no longer accessible via the API. A `200` (new) or `304` (cached) response will be sent with messages organized from most recent to least recent. Note that the `created` field is in a ISO 8601 format.

```json
{
    "msg": "Successfully got the latest messages!",
    "page": 1,
    "messages": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "poster": "acct123",
            "title": "Where is everyone??",
            "content": "Is this assignment released yet?",
            "chatroom": "Bascom Hill Chatters",
            "created": "2023-10-14T21:06:15.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "poster": "acct123",
            "title": "Hello! ðŸ‘‹",
            "content": "Welcome to BadgerChat! ðŸ¦¡",
            "chatroom": "Bascom Hill Chatters",
            "created": "2023-10-14T20:48:53.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

If an invalid page number is specified, a `400` will be returned.

```json
{
    "msg": "A page number must be between 1 and 4."
}
```

If a chatroom is specified that does not exist, a `404` will be returned.

```json
{
    "msg": "The specified chatroom does not exist. Chatroom names are case-sensitive."
}
```

### Registering a User
`POST` `https://cs571.org/api/f23/hw11/register`

You must register a user with a specified `username` and `password`. 

Requests must include credentials as well as a header `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Example Request Body**

```json
{
    "username": "test12456",
    "password": "p@ssw0rd1"
}
```

If the registration is successful, the following `200` will be sent...
```json
{
    "msg": "Successfully authenticated.",
    "user": {
        "id": 5,
        "username": "test12456"
    },
    "eat": 1697500160
}
```

A `Set-Cookie` response header will include your JWT in `badgerchat_auth`. This is *not* accessible by JavaScript. The provided token is an irrevocable JWT that will be valid for **1 hour**. All future requests that include credentials will send this cookie with the request.

`eat` specifies the time (as seconds since epoch) when the provided `badgerchat_auth` will expire.

If you forget to include a `username` or `password`, the following `400` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "A request must contain a 'username' and 'password'"
}
```

If a user by the requested `username` already exists, the following `409` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "The user already exists!"
}
```

If the `username` is longer than 64 characters or if the `password` is longer than 128 characters, the following `413` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "'username' must be 64 characters or fewer and 'password' must be 128 characters or fewer"
}
```

### Logging in to an Account

`POST` `https://cs571.org/api/f23/hw11/login`

You must log a user in with their specified `username` and `password`.

Requests must include credentials as well as a header `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Example Request Body**

```json
{
    "username": "test12456",
    "password": "p@ssw0rd1"
}
```

If the login is successful, the following `200` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "Successfully authenticated.",
    "user": {
        "id": 5,
        "username": "test12456"
    },
    "eat": 1697500737
}
```

A `Set-Cookie` response header will include your JWT in `badgerchat_auth`. This is *not* accessible by JavaScript. The provided token is an irrevocable JWT that will be valid for **1 hour**. All future requests that include credentials will send this cookie with the request.

`eat` specifies the time (as seconds since epoch) when the provided `badgerchat_auth` will expire.

If you forget the `username` or `password`, the following `400` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "A request must contain a 'username' and 'password'"
}
```

If the `username` or `password` is incorrect, the following `401` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "That username or password is incorrect!"
}
```

### Posting a Message

}
```
